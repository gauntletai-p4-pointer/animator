Given the apis for Spine2D: https://esotericsoftware.com/spine-api-reference

Could you illustrate with a list of commented api calls how you might programmatically animate a Spine2D character, say by generating a walking animation?

Assume we would use a Spine2D runtime (https://esotericsoftware.com/spine-runtimes) for the web, in TypeScript. Ask me if you need to clarify something.

I'll fetch the Spine2D API reference to understand the available methods and then provide a comprehensive example of programmatically animating a walking cycle.Based on the Spine2D API reference, I'll provide a comprehensive example of how to programmatically animate a Spine2D character with a walking animation. Here's a detailed list of commented API calls for creating a walking animation:This comprehensive example demonstrates how to programmatically create a walking animation using Spine2D APIs. Here are the key concepts illustrated:

## **Core Animation Components:**

1. **Animation Setup**: Creating an `Animation` object with specified duration and timelines
2. **Timeline Types**: Using `RotateTimeline`, `TranslateTimeline`, and `EventTimeline` for different animation properties
3. **Keyframe Management**: Setting frames with `setFrame()` and interpolation with `setLinear()`

## **Walking Cycle Implementation:**

1. **Bone Hierarchies**: Animating thigh, shin, and foot bones in coordinated movement
2. **Phase Relationships**: Left and right legs moving 180° out of phase
3. **Secondary Animation**: Arms swinging opposite to legs for natural movement
4. **Body Dynamics**: Subtle vertical movement and torso rotation

## **Advanced Features:**

1. **Animation State Management**: Using `AnimationState` for playback control
2. **Mixing/Blending**: Smooth transitions between animations
3. **Event Handling**: Adding footstep events for audio synchronization
4. **Runtime Control**: Functions for starting, stopping, and adjusting speed

## **Key API Patterns:**

- **Bone References**: Using `skeleton.findBone()` to get bone indices
- **Timeline Creation**: Instantiating timeline objects with frame counts
- **Interpolation**: Setting smooth transitions between keyframes
- **Loop Control**: Configuring animations to repeat seamlessly

The example creates a realistic walking cycle that can be easily modified for different character types, walking speeds, or terrain conditions. Would you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of the animation system or add additional features like dynamic foot placement or terrain adaptation?

What would I need to provide as input to get this running? I see "character.json"—what's its expected format? 

Can you also show code to display this walking animation in the browser?

Great questions! Let me break down what you need to get this running in a browser.

## Required Input Files## Quick Start Guide

### 1. **Install Dependencies**
```bash
npm init -y
npm install @esotericsoftware/spine-webgl
npm install -D typescript http-server
```

### 2. **Required Files Structure**
```
project/
├── index.html
├── assets/
│   ├── character.json     # Skeleton structure (see example above)
│   ├── character.atlas    # Texture coordinates
│   └── character.png      # Sprite sheet image
└── src/
    └── main.ts           # Your animation code
```

### 3. **Character.json Format**
The JSON file contains:
- **Skeleton metadata** (dimensions, version)
- **Bones hierarchy** (parent-child relationships, transforms)
- **Slots** (drawable components attached to bones)
- **Skins** (attachment definitions)
- **Animations** (optional, since we're creating them programmatically)

### 4. **Atlas File Format**
Plain text file describing texture regions:
```
character.png
size: 512,512
format: RGBA8888
filter: Linear,Linear
repeat: none
head
  rotate: false
  xy: 2, 2
  size: 64, 64
  orig: 64, 64
  offset: 0, 0
  index: -1
```

### 5. **Getting Assets**

**Option A: Create from Spine Editor**
- Export from Spine Professional (recommended)
- Includes optimized atlas packing

**Option B: Manual Creation**
- Use the example JSON structure provided
- Create simple colored rectangles as PNG
- Write basic atlas file

**Option C: Use Spine Examples**
- Download from [Spine Examples](https://github.com/EsotericSoftware/spine-runtimes)
- Copy raptor, spineboy, or other character assets

### 6. **Run the Demo**
```bash
npm run build
npm run serve
# Visit http://localhost:8080
```

The code provides a complete working example with:
- ✅ WebGL rendering setup
- ✅ Asset loading and management  
- ✅ Programmatic animation creation
- ✅ Interactive controls (start/stop/speed)
- ✅ Proper animation loop

The key insight is that Spine2D separates the **skeleton structure** (bones, slots) from the **animation data** (timelines). You can load a basic character structure and then add complex animations programmatically using the Timeline APIs!
