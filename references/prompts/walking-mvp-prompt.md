 Consider @references/spine/, with most files generated from the previous chat represented by @references/spine/walking-mvp.md. Consider as well @assets, where we have the Spine2D example project for Spineboy. We want to use these references and/or assets to implement a barebones MVP that:
 
 - loads the necessary assets, allowing the user to upload them in labeled areas if necessary
 - shows a preview of a walking animation using the Spine runtime on the web.

 Our existing app, described in @package.json, is a fresh NextJS template with React, tailwind, and TypeScript.
