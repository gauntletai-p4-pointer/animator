# **Gauntlet AI Open Source Week**

## **Building Industry-Specific AI Agents**

### **üéØ Introduction**

Contributing to the open source AI community is a rite of passage for anyone who calls themselves an AI engineer. Open source software has pioneered new inventions and techniques that have supercharged tech as a whole.

**The Software Paradigm Shift** As [Andrej Karpathy outlined](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCEmiRjPEtQ&pp=ygUPYW5kcmVqIGthcnBhdGh5), we're living through a fundamental transition in software development:

* **Software 1.0**: Traditional Code  
* **Software 2.0**: Neural Networks  
* **Software 3.0**: LLM Programming

We're in the "1960s era" of LLM computing \- expensive but revolutionary. LLMs function as a new kind of operating system, and we're building the applications that run on top of them.

**Why Cursor Succeeded** Cursor achieved what Karpathy calls "Software 3.0" \- they built an LLM application that:

* Manages context intelligently (solving the "anterograde amnesia" problem)  
* Uses AI for generation while humans handle verification  
* Works in incremental chunks with visual interfaces  
* Maintains humans in the loop for complex software decisions

Your goal is to bring this "Cursor experience" to another industry \- building an AI agent that understands context, makes intelligent decisions, and automates complex workflows while keeping humans in the verification loop.

### **üìã The Task**

**Objective**: Build and launch an open source AI agent that brings the "Cursor experience" to a specific industry.

**Core Concept**: Think "How can I bring the Cursor experience to X?" where X is your chosen industry. Your agent should be autonomous \- able to understand context, make intelligent decisions, and take action \- while being designed for human verification and guidance.

**Team Size**: 3-5 members (larger teams are expected to deliver more sophisticated solutions)

**Timeline**: 1 week

**Deliverables**:

On Sunday, you'll need to submit the following:

1. **GitHub Repository:** A link to your project's public GitHub repository with complete source code and documentation

2. **Live Demo:** Give a 5-minute demo to the cohort showing your agent in action and explaining how you built it

3. **BrainLift**: A link to the document you used to learn, understand, and enhance the application with AI workflows

4. **Social Media Post:** A link to a post on X (Twitter) or LinkedIn showcasing your process of building with AI workflows, key technical achievements, or insights gained during development

### **üìè Guidelines**

**Industry Selection**

* Choose a specific industry or profession (healthcare, legal, finance, education, design, marketing, etc.)  
* Identify workflows that suffer from "context window amnesia" \- where professionals lose track of info across complex processes  
* Look for domains where "AI does generation, humans do verification" makes sense  
* Find opportunities where visual interfaces can speed up verification processes

**The Agent Design Framework** Using Karpathy's insights, your agent should:

* **Context Management**: Solve the "anterograde amnesia" problem by maintaining relevant context across workflows  
* **Generation \+ Verification**: AI handles the heavy lifting, humans verify and guide decisions  
* **Incremental Processing**: Work in small, manageable chunks that humans can easily review  
* **Visual Interface**: Create interfaces that make verification fast and intuitive  
* **Partial Autonomy**: Build "autonomy sliders" \- let users control how much the agent does independently

**Technical Requirements**

* **Context Management**: Intelligent handling of relevant information across multi-step workflows  
* **Generation \+ Verification Pattern**: AI generates, humans verify and guide  
* **Incremental Processing**: Break complex tasks into reviewable chunks  
* **Visual Verification Interface**: Make human oversight fast and intuitive  
* **Partial Autonomy Controls**: Allow users to adjust how much the agent does independently  
* Clean, well-documented code with proper GitHub repository  
* Open source license (MIT, Apache 2.0, etc.)

**Avoid These Pitfalls**

* Don't build fully autonomous systems (software is tricky, keep humans in the loop)  
* Don't ignore context management (this is what makes or breaks LLM applications)  
* Don't make verification slow or text-heavy (use visual interfaces)  
* Don't try to solve everything (work in small, incremental chunks)

**Development Process**

* Days 1-2: Research industry \+ define agent capabilities  
* Days 3-5: Build core agent functionality  
* Days 6-7: Integration, testing, and documentation

**Team Collaboration**

* All members must contribute meaningfully to the codebase  
* Use proper version control with meaningful commits  
* Assign clear roles and responsibilities

### **üèÜ Grading Criteria**

**Agent Implementation (50%)**

* Autonomous functionality demonstration  
* Context management and decision-making capabilities  
* Human verification integration  
* Code quality and working prototype

**Industry Application (30%)**

* Depth of industry understanding  
* Clear workflow automation and time saving  
* Innovation and real-world adoption potential

**Open Source Contribution (15%)**

* Repository organization and documentation quality  
* Installation clarity and community engagement potential

**Team Collaboration (5%)**

* Equal contribution and effective project management  
* Sunday presentation quality

### **üöÄ Getting Started**

1. **Form Your Team**: Connect with 3-5 other students  
2. **Choose Your Industry**: Research and select your target industry  
3. **Define Your Agent**: Focus on one workflow that suffers from context loss and needs generation \+ verification  
4. **Build Context Management**: Start with how your agent will maintain relevant information across the workflow

### **üí° Success Tips**

* **Context First**: Build an agent that remembers and uses relevant information across complex workflows  
* **Visual Interfaces**: Create interfaces that make verification fast \- text is hard to read and interpret  
* **Incremental Wins**: Perfect one workflow that can be broken into reviewable chunks  
* **Autonomy with Control**: Give users control over how much the agent does independently

**Remember**: We're in the "decade of agents" but software is still tricky. Focus on partial autonomy products with autonomy sliders. The goal is to amplify human capability, not replace human judgment. üöÄ
