For generating sprite sheets and 2D animations for game characters, here are the main AI approaches currently available:

## Text-to-Image Models with Sprite Sheet Capabilities

**Stable Diffusion** (with specific fine-tunes) is probably your best bet for simple prompting. Some approaches:
- Use models fine-tuned for pixel art like "Pixel Art Diffusion" or "PixelartDiffusionXL"
- Add prompts like "sprite sheet", "multiple poses", "character turnaround" to generate sheets
- Use ControlNet with pose references to maintain consistency across frames

**Midjourney** can generate sprite-style artwork but has limitations:
- Good for individual sprites or concept art
- Less reliable for consistent multi-frame animations
- Use parameters like `--tile` for seamless patterns

## Specialized Animation Tools

**Cascadeur** - AI-assisted animation tool that can generate in-between frames and apply physics-based motion to 2D characters

**Runway ML** - Has specific tools for frame interpolation and animation generation from static images

## Workflow Approaches

1. **Generate base character** → Use AI to create your character design
2. **Create key poses** → Generate 4-8 key frames using consistent prompts/seeds
3. **Interpolate frames** → Use AI video tools to generate in-between frames
4. **Clean up** → May need manual pixel art cleanup for game-ready assets

## Consistency Tips

- Use the same seed number across generations
- Include detailed character descriptions in every prompt
- Use reference images with img2img workflows
- Consider using LoRA training on your character for better consistency

The technology is evolving rapidly, but currently you'll likely need some manual cleanup for production-ready game sprites. Would you like me to search for the latest tools or dive deeper into any specific approach?
