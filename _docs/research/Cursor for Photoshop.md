Looking at this project through the lens of "Cursor for Photoshop," here's how I'd approach building a web-based AI-powered design tool that nails the core requirements:

## **Core Concept: DesignFlow AI**
A simplified web-based design tool where AI understands your design intent, maintains context across your entire creative process, and generates suggestions while you verify and refine.

## **Key Features & Requirements Alignment**

### **1. Context Management (Solving "Anterograde Amnesia")**

**Smart Design Memory:**
- **Project History Tracking**: AI remembers every design decision, layer creation, color choice, and modification with reasoning
- **Intent Recognition**: "I'm designing a mobile app login screen" → AI maintains this context across all subsequent actions
- **Style Consistency Engine**: AI learns your design patterns and suggests consistent elements (fonts, colors, spacing)
- **Cross-Session Context**: Resume projects with AI remembering not just what you built, but *why* you built it

**Example**: You start a logo design, choose blue (#2563eb), add rounded corners (8px radius). Later when adding a button, AI suggests the same blue and corner radius because it understands this is part of your established design system.

### **2. Generation + Verification Pattern**

**AI Generates, You Verify:**
- **Smart Layer Suggestions**: AI proposes new layers, effects, or adjustments based on context
- **Auto-Complete Design Elements**: Start drawing a button → AI suggests completing it with proper padding, typography, states
- **Intelligent Asset Generation**: "Add a hero section background" → AI generates 3-4 options, you pick and refine
- **Code Export Suggestions**: AI generates CSS/HTML that matches your design, you review before export

### **3. Incremental Processing**

**Chunk-Based Workflow:**
- **Component-Level Thinking**: Design broken into reviewable components (header, card, button, etc.)
- **Step-by-Step Guidance**: "Let's design the navigation bar" → AI guides through logo placement, menu items, responsive behavior
- **Micro-Decisions**: Each AI suggestion is small enough to quickly approve/reject (single color change, one layer adjustment)
- **Undo Intelligence**: AI understands which changes are related and groups them for smart undo

### **4. Visual Verification Interface**

**Fast, Intuitive Oversight:**
- **Hover Previews**: Hover over AI suggestions to see immediate visual previews
- **Side-by-Side Comparisons**: "Before/After" views for every AI suggestion
- **One-Click Approval**: Green checkmark to accept, red X to reject, yellow pencil to modify
- **Visual Diff Highlighting**: Changes highlighted with subtle overlays showing exactly what AI modified

### **5. Partial Autonomy Controls ("Autonomy Sliders")**

**Configurable AI Assistance:**
- **Suggestion Frequency**: Slider from "Minimal hints" to "Proactive suggestions"
- **Auto-Apply Threshold**: Control what AI can do automatically vs. what needs approval
- **Skill Level Adaptation**: Beginner mode (more guidance) vs. Expert mode (fewer interruptions)
- **Domain Focus**: Adjust AI personality for web design, mobile apps, print, branding, etc.

## **Technical Architecture**

### **Context Management System**
```javascript
// Design Context Engine
class DesignContext {
  projectIntent: string;         // "mobile app login screen"
  designSystem: StyleGuide;      // learned colors, fonts, spacing
  componentLibrary: Component[]; // reusable elements
  decisionHistory: Decision[];   // why choices were made
  currentFocus: DesignArea;      // what user is working on now
}
```

### **AI Integration Points**
- **Computer Vision**: Analyze current canvas state and suggest improvements
- **Design Pattern Recognition**: Learn from user behavior and industry best practices
- **Natural Language Processing**: "Make this more modern" → specific design adjustments
- **Generative Models**: Create assets, backgrounds, icons on demand

## **Specific Workflow Example**

**Scenario**: Designing a SaaS landing page

1. **Context Setup**: User says "I'm designing a SaaS landing page for a project management tool"
2. **AI Response**: Suggests wireframe layout with hero section, features grid, testimonials
3. **Incremental Building**: 
   - Hero section: AI suggests headline copy, CTA button styling, background options
   - Each suggestion shown as visual preview with one-click approval
   - User verifies each element before moving to next section
4. **Context Retention**: When adding pricing section later, AI suggests consistent button styles from hero section
5. **Visual Verification**: All changes shown with before/after comparisons

## **Why This Nails the Requirements**

- ✅ **Industry-Specific**: Directly targets design professionals and their workflows
- ✅ **Context Management**: Remembers design decisions and intent across entire project lifecycle
- ✅ **Generation + Verification**: AI suggests, human approves every change
- ✅ **Incremental Processing**: Design broken into component-level decisions
- ✅ **Visual Interface**: Everything verified through visual previews, not text
- ✅ **Partial Autonomy**: Users control how much AI assistance they want
- ✅ **Real Workflow Value**: Solves actual pain points in design process (maintaining consistency, generating ideas, speeding up repetitive tasks)

This approach brings the "Cursor experience" to design by making AI a collaborative partner that enhances creativity while keeping humans firmly in control of the artistic vision.
