Yes, there are several AI models and tools that can help with character swapping in sprite sheets and animations, though the quality and ease of use varies:

**AI-Powered Tools:**

- **RunwayML** - Offers video editing tools that can do character replacement in animations, though it's more focused on video than sprite sheets
- **Ebsynth** - Uses AI to transfer the style/appearance from one frame to animate an entire sequence, which can work for character swapping
- **Adobe Character Animator** - Has AI features for puppet-based animation that can swap character rigs
- **Stable Diffusion with ControlNet** - Can be used with pose/depth maps to generate new characters in the same poses as your original sprite sheet

**Specialized Game Dev Tools:**

- **Cascadeur** - AI-assisted animation tool that can retarget animations to different character rigs
- **Mixamo** - Adobe's tool that can retarget animations between different 3D character models (though this is more for 3D)

**Workflow Approaches:** The most practical current approach often involves:

1. Using pose detection AI (like OpenPose) to extract the skeletal structure from your original animation
2. Using that pose data with image generation AI to create new characters in those same poses
3. Tools like ComfyUI or Automatic1111 with ControlNet extensions can handle this workflow

**Limitations:** Most current AI tools work better with realistic characters than stylized sprites, and you'll likely need to do some manual cleanup. The technology is rapidly improving though, with new tools launching regularly that specifically target game development workflows.

Would you like me to search for the latest tools in this space, as this is a rapidly evolving field?

You're absolutely right - Cascadeur is 3D focused. For 2D sprite animation retargeting, the options are more limited but here are the best approaches:

**2D-Specific AI Tools:**

- **EbSynth** - This is probably the closest to what you want. It can transfer the style/appearance of one character to match the motion of another 2D animation
- **Animated Drawings (Meta/Facebook Research)** - Can take a single drawing and animate it based on motion from other animations
- **LeiaPix** - Has some 2D animation retargeting features, though more experimental

**2D Workflow Solutions:**

- **OpenPose + Stable Diffusion/ControlNet** - Extract pose keyframes from your original sprite animation, then generate new character sprites matching those poses
- **DensePose** - Similar to OpenPose but with more detailed body mapping for better 2D character swapping
- **Pose2Pose tools** in ComfyUI or similar - Can maintain consistent character appearance across different poses

**Manual + AI Hybrid:**

- Use **DragonBones** or **Spine** to create a 2D skeleton rig, then swap out the character parts while keeping the animation data
- **Adobe Character Animator** can work with 2D puppets and has some AI features for expression/pose matching

**Emerging Tools:** The 2D animation retargeting space is less mature than 3D, but tools like **Stable Video Diffusion** and **AnimateDiff** are starting to show promise for 2D character consistency across animation frames.

The reality is that 2D sprite animation retargeting is still quite manual compared to 3D. Most game developers end up redrawing sprites or using modular character systems rather than AI retargeting.
